    <dt><strong>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Before taking PROG 109, I had no experience or any knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript.</dd>
    
    <dt><br><strong>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</strong></dt>
    <dd>I built my portfolio from scratch.</dd>
    
    <dt><br><strong>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</strong></dt>
      <dd>Definitely CSS. For each page, I had to find the right size and alignment to make my page look neat.
        I also had to find colors that would match well with the page. Thus, designing my webpage was very challenging.</dd>
    
    <dt><br><strong>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</strong></dt>
    <dd>I learned that creating web page isn't easy as I thought. It requires lot of knowledge both in coding and designing.
      I find Web Development as somewhat similar to fashion designing. You need to have good view of colors, alignments, and 
      details. Furthermore, you need to know coding, which makes Web Development a little more challenging than just programming class.</dd>
    
    <dt><br><strong>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</strong></dt>
    <dd>I would highly recommend future students to get an idea of what Web Development is before taking this class.
      If I had known about how Web Development works, I wouldn't have struggled too much. Furthermore, I would tell them to 
      study examples of simple web pages they find on internet, such as people's blog or personal portfolios.</dd>
