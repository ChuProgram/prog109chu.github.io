        <dt><strong>What did you know before this class?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Prior to taking PROG109, which is a Web Development course, I had little knowledge of coding language called “C#”. I took a basic course before, so I knew little bit of how coding worked. However, I learned to realize that even though there are lot
          of similarities between Web Development and C#, the language itself is totally different. For instance, when I was writing a code using JavaScript, I had difficult time understanding how the language works here, because it does not use same
          type of code used in C#.<br></dd>

          <dt><strong>What knowledge/skills did you gain after this class? </strong></dt>
        <dd>After taking PROG109, I learned little basic about web development. Specifically, I learned how to use HTML, and read source codes in web pages. Although I still need lot more practice, I am glad I gained little knowledge of how websites work
          and how they are created.</dd><br><br>

        <dt><strong>What did you know before this class?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Before taking PROG 110, which is an Introduction to Programming course, I had little knowledge about coding. 
          I have previously taken Computer Science class, so I was familiar with the codes used in this class. This course uses programming 
          language called <strong>C#</strong>. Even though, I first learned coding with Java language, there wasn’t big difference between C# and Java.
          Thus, I was comfortable with writing codes, and I did not struggle too much.<br></dd>
                    
          <dt><strong>What knowledge/skills did you gain after this class? </strong></dt>
        <dd>I gained lot of knowledge in using Visual Studio, which is the coding program used in this course. The Visual Studio allows you 
          to write code using C# language. Furthermore, I have created many programs, such as calculating the total price and showing invoice 
          of receipt when user inputs their choice of number of objects to purchase. As a result, I have gained more knowledge in coding.</dd>
